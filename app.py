st.write(
    "- Machine Learning techniques have great potential to **analyze complex maritime data from various sensors**, such as detecting species of fish from videos or observe habitat changes over time through sensors."
)

st.write(
    "- One application of machine learning in marine biology is to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to **detect and count marine animals in an image or video**."
)

st.write(
    "- Even **audio recordings** can be analyzed in a similar fashion. It is possible to convert other mediums into their **image representation** to leverage the high utility of CNNs. For example, an audio sample can be converted into a **spectrogram** that is then fed to the model."
)

st.write(
    "**Objective:** In this project, I use Deep Learning (DL) to develop a model capable of classifying marine animals based on audio recordings."
)

st.subheader("Method")

st.write(
    "I used a subset of the 'Best of' Audio files from the Watkins Marine Mammal Sound Database. I chose a subset of five different species from the whole database for this project. Thus, the five categories are Narwhal, Walrus, Harp Seal, Spinner Dolphin, and Killer Whale. I used a Python script to download 30 to 40 samples of audio recordings for each category."

Then, I fine-tuned the convolutional neural network Resnet34 for 10 epochs using a learning rate of 0.00083. Finally, I exported the model and generated a confusion matrix to find the model's confusion points."

    "This project gave me the opportunity to explore an application of machine learning in marine biology. There has been extensive research in species identification using audio and machine learning, but future directions include identifying individuals within a species."

st.write(
    "In the process, I faced some challenges in working with the audio of marine animals."
)

st.write(
    "- It is difficult to know exactly what in the audio files the machine learning model is using to make its classifications. For example, the ambient noise, the microphone used, and other acoustic effects can have a large impact on the predictions, making it less likely that the model will generalize to new samples taken at a different time with different audio equipment. "
)

st.write(
    "- The audio quality of the samples varies greatly, with some samples containing very little of the marine animal and more of the environment."
)

st.write(
    "- The audio samples vary in length, so the spectrograms are not standardized. "
)

st.write(
    "The main things I learned from this project were how to use transfer learning to fine-tune a pre-trained model, and a little insight into some of the challenges of working with audio files and in the field of marine biology!"
